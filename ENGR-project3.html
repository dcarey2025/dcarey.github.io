Our task, to assemble a digital alarm clock from electric components, proved to be one of the most rewarding activities in the class. Of course, this would all be tempered by one of the most daunting assignments as we took our first steps into the Fusion360 CAD software.</p></div>

                                After meticulously attaching each electronic component onto our circuitboard, we were tasked with designing a  box in which our newly-built clocks could live. In order to design one such box, though, we first needed to take precise measurements of our completed device. Using calipers, we were able to confidently measure the dimensions of our circuitboard and extruding components, and were able to begin designing our container.

                            With our measurements taken, we started throwing together a schematic for how we wanted our box to function. Deciding on a tight block joint to separate our box into two pieces, we drew up designs for button pegs to press onto the circuitboard, a battery holder that would sit on the bottom face, as well as adequate spacing for all the holes to fit above the circuitboard's components.

                                Our first few attempts (3 of them to be exact) at bringing our designs to life unfortunately did not pan out accordingly, as a result of certain measurements not translating across onto Fusion360 correctly. After slowly working the kinks out of our design, however, we were finally able to 3D-print a box that fit our circuitboard. There was only one problem, though, and what success we had enjoyed was quickly diminished as we realized that our block joints did not fit in their corresponding holes, as a result of the printer's overextruding, or some other CAM-related inaccuracy.

                            But I would not let such a minor mishap defeat me, and in an unprecedented surge of defiance, decided to take matters into my own hands. Utilizing the tools available to me, I began tirelessly filing away at the box's pegs until they snugly slotted into their positions. After what seemed like forever, our clock finally had a home.

                                The only thing left was to design the buttons for controlling the clock's functions. Since the peg would have to straddle the hole so as to not fall out, the button had to be separated into two parts: the peg and the cap. Quickly throwing together a prototype in Fusion360, we printed both pieces and attempted to line them up with the clock's buttons.

                                After only a few iterations (and an overwhelming amount of hot glue) the buttons were properly installed and worked as intended, everything fitting perfectly inside of the box.

                            Although some pieces didn't align as perfectly as we had hoped, the end product clock was in perfect working condition and all of the parameters of the assignment were completely functional, and in that sense our project was a complete success. With some more minor design tweaking, a substantial amount of the pain could most likely be alleviated by a few slight measurement adjustments, but I would say this project had already taken more TIME than it was worth!
