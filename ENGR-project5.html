                            Our fifth project, the last one befeore our final projects, posed a new challenge by introducing us to yet another new CAM machine: the MIRA Laser cutters. Fortunately, the project assignment was something familiar, a triumphant return of none other than -- the dreaded clock boxes. However, this time we wouldn't be designing for a 3-D printer, but rather cutting plywood walls into a parametric box.

                                Using dimensions of the same soldered circuitboard from our previous box designs, our new box designed for the lasercutters will have to be parametric in nature - that is, each face must be designed and cut from the 3mm plywood separately, and assembled afterwards.

                            Using Fusion360, the variables tab was very helpful in constraining different values to specific fitted measurements, as they were easily changed and were less susceptible to errors. Using such constraints along with the projection tool, we were able to follow a simple guide and create a rudimentary parametric box with interlocking tabs.

                            Individually taking the projections of our newly drawn faces allowed us to save each one as a 2D image and import them into the MIRA's companion CAM software, Lightburn. Lightburn was very self explanatory, as all we needed to do was import our .dxt files and arrange them into the top corner of the plane, or wherever on our plywood board had not been cut yet.

                            Getting to watch the Mira cut out our designed pieces was nothing short of mesmerizing, as the laser smoothly glided along the board and cut, almost too perfectly, each of our pieces. The first assembly of Parametric Box V1 was a complete success,and all of the interlocking tabs fit perfectly as intended. The only minor flaw was that of the design itself, as the faces needed to be adhered together with glue or tape in order to remain connected.

                                Wanting to improve this aspect of the design, I decided to go back to CAD and add interlocking pegs to each of the box faces. With these additional parts, each face of the box would snugly fit together without any additional adhesives required.

                            Going back and trying to edit the faces, however, proved to be more trouble than I had bargained for, as every change I made along my timeline seemed to only cause problems for everything else, since all of the faces were generated iteratively.

                             Eventually, though, I was able to sort through each error and create the modified faces that I was looking for. Repeating the Lightburn steps from before, I was very pleased to find that my new parametric clock box fit together snugly without any adhesives whatsoever, even stronger that the first iteration. Satisfied with my design, I was able to test the fit of the circuitboard from the original clock box project, pleased to find that it was in fact a perfect fit.
