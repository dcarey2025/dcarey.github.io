The accompanying assembly documentation was not only thorough but also generally informative, as each challenging step came with its own expert tip, including inventive out-of-the-box ways to use our tools, the most efficient way to lay out the parts, and even the optimal times to take a delicious and reenergizing snack break! <br><br> My wonderful partner, Sophia, and I, found a tremendous amount of synergy in working together, which the documentation certainly contributed to. It was so streamlined, in fact, that we were able to complete our construction within only a few hours, among the first to do so among our classmates!</p>

Our version of the MINIs included an added filament sensor, which made it significantly harder to navigate the brittle PLA plastic through the tube. Each time we would try to push the filament through, it would bend and break, or the Prusa simply wouldn't grab onto the material. There were only a few simply things we were doing wrong throughout this process, but there was no documentation on these initial calibration steps for us to refer to. Still, with just a bit of direction, we were able to successfully load our dazzling pink filament into our printer, primed and ready for our first print!</p></div>

                                Constructing our printer allowed us the ability to start our first print early, which we were very eager to take advantage of! Printing the classic 3DBenchy was amazing to watch, especially only having assembled our Prusa from assorted disconnected pieces only hours before. The finished project was streamlined, smooth, and beautiful, despite sufferring from a minor amount of nozzle stringing.
