The accompanying assembly documentation was not only thorough but also generally informative, as each challenging step came with its own expert tip, including inventive out-of-the-box ways to use our tools, the most efficient way to lay out the parts, and even the optimal times to take a delicious and reenergizing snack break! <br><br> My wonderful partner, Sophia, and I, found a tremendous amount of synergy in working together, which the documentation certainly contributed to. It was so streamlined, in fact, that we were able to complete our construction within only a few hours, among the first to do so among our peers.</p>

Our version of the MINIs included an added filament sensor, which made it significantly harder to navigate the brittle PLA plastic through the tube. Each time we would try to push the filament through, it would bend and break, or the Prusa simply wouldn't grab onto the material. There were only a few simply things we were doing wrong throughout this process, but there was no documentation on these initial calibration steps for us to refer to. Still, with just a bit of direction, we were able to successfully load our dazzling pink filament into our printer, primed and ready for our first print!</p></div>

                                Constructing our printer allowed us the ability to start our first print early, which we were very eager to take advantage of! Printing the classic 3DBenchy was amazing to watch, especially only having assembled our Prusa from assorted disconnected pieces only hours before. The finished product was streamlined, smooth, and beautiful, despite sufferring from a minor amount of nozzle stringing. Wanting to improve upon our Benchy design, we used the open-source troubleshooting guide provided at https://www.simplify3d.com/resources/print-quality-troubleshooting/, allowing us to identify key changes within PrusaSlicer's print settings and preventing further stringing problems with our future prints, specifically by increasing the nozzle retraction speed during printing.

                            Wanting to optimize further, however, we decided to challenge the Prusa's speed optimization by shortening its print time of the Benchy without significantly reducing its quality. By reducing the print layering and increasing the nozzle movement within reasonable bounds, we were able to print an almost identical Benchy to our stock model, in less than 1/3 of the original time. It was so quick, in fact, that we were able to record the print in a single time-lapsed video, shown above.

                               Satisfied with our speedy Benchy optimization, but still craving further exploration into the vast world of engineering design, we decided to undertake our most ambitious venture yet: to modify a real-world, functionally floating Benchy model. Working under time pressure as class was ending, I dove headfirst into the AutoDesk Fusion360 CAD program, stumbling my way through interfaces and keybinds in order to make the simplest alterations to our library model. After a lengthy ordeal and no small amount of effort, I finally managed to brute force two identical cylinders onto each side of the boat, simulating real-world pontoons. Our Benchy Mk.III was finally ready for her first ever seaworthy voyage. <br><br>And boy, she did not disappoint.

                            The process of conceptualizing a problem and working through the design rationale to draft and execute a working solution awarded a degree of fulfillment that simply cannot be restated. The culmination of hours of learning and hard work came to a precise and bright climax, upon which we could truly revel in our accomplishments and the steps it took for us to finally reach that point. Still, for as fulfilling as this particular journey was, it is but the first of many to come, and I am truly eager for each and every one of them.
