                            For our second project, we would be fully submerged into a vast and unfamiliar world: CAD, or Computer Aided Design. The tools and methodologies employed in this project lay the foundations for the rest of the work we have done in this class, as well as provide a framework for how to approach deisgn problems in life as a whole. Our task, to import and edit an existing 3D model in a CAD tool of our choice, allows for a wide range of creativity and innovative thinking when it comes to solving deisgn challenges both in and out of the lab.

                                The first step of every great project, of course, is to identify a problem that needs solving! For me, all it took was a glance around my living room -- into the corner, to be exact -- and I knew almost immediately what it was I wanted to do. <br></br>
                                Like every little boy, I was always an avid Star Wars fan growing up and dreamed of having my very own Death Star model. And, of course, like every responsible adult, I decided to make this dream a reality!

                            So, after searching online for open source files, I finally came across this beauty of a design. Isn't she just absolutely gorgeous??? That texturing is just... mwah! It's almost too much to handle! Actually, it was too much to handle, for TinkerCad anyways. The polygons were just too powerful! This wasn't much of a problem though, all I had to do was pop the old girl into MeshLab and decimate some triangles. (R.I.P. sharp textures)

                                With my newly resized object file, I was now able to import my Death Star into my CAD software and begin *tinkering* with the design. Drawing up the rough plans shown below, I envisioned out how I would display my glorious creation after it had been made into reality. I wanted to hollow out the inside of the sphere, to save on material cost, printing time, and weight, but also for my own ulterior motives... In order to be mounted, I would have to accurately measure the diameter at the bottom: not too small so that the pole wouldn't fit, and not too large so that the supportive disk wouldn't fall through as well. 
                            </p>

                            Of Course, implementing all of my design features would prove to be a substantial task in its own right, as I would have to find a way to hollow out most of the sphere without compromising its structural and textural integrity. That's when I thought back to one of the lectures we had in class. Yes, I could use an assortment of polygons to manually hollow out the inside of the sphere, but that was proving to be tedious and messy because of the external face not being a uniform sphere. Instead, it was much easier to let the CAD software do the work for me by utilizing the subtractive techniches that I had learned. By duplicating the model's structure and shrinking it by just a few centimeters in each direction, I was able to cut a perfectly concentric hole out of the center of the sphere, with uniform thickness of 1cm at every point along the sphere.
                        </p></div>

                            Now that the sphere was hollow it was time to cut out my hole. With the measurements from home at hand, I determined that a 6 cm circular hole would be the perfect size for my setup, and cut a cylindrical hole through the bottom part of the sphere to boot. I was quite excited with how my model was turning out so far, but was still a little nervous. Because of the sheer size of my magnificent Death Star, I was worried that the sphere's weight might compromise its print integrity, especially with a wall thickness of only 1 cm. So, I took to designing and fitting supports to the inside of my model, both to help with printing but also to improve the structural stability when on display.

                            I first designed four pillars that would stand at opposite 'corners' of the sphere's interior, relieving stress from the top to the bottom of the structure. I then connected these pillars with two diagonal cross-bars that formed an X along the top of the sphere, to provide horizontal support as well. Finally, I capped each pillar off with a series of pyramid caps whose sloped faces would interface with the interior wall of the sphere, allowing for a smooth and secure anchor point with which the supports would hold on to. With all of my components joined together, I was finally ready to move my model into its CAM phase.

                                Because she was such a big model, I set up my print on one of the larger Raise3D printers over the Prusa Minis. This also meant that I wouldn't have to worry as much about printing errors because of the Raise's contained printbed. This was definitely a good thing because the print time estimation after splicing clocked in at over 5 days, using almost a full kilogram of material including the support material that I autogenerated along the exterior of the model overhanging above the print bed.

                            Starting off the print was met with a profound rush of anticipation and excitement. After watching the first few layers of raft adhere smoothly to the print bed, I forced my eyes away from the machine and left it to begin its long and arduous journey. It was three days until I was able to check up on the printer again, upon which I was ecstatic at what I was met with.

                            Examining my creation, I was surprised with the remarkable integrity of the material and how well the print quality had held up. I believed there were multiple factors contributing to this, including the structurally sound geometry of a sphere providing natural strength, my additional supports bolstering internal connectivity, and the quality of the Raise3D contransted against that of the Prusa's when it came to fine detailing.

                                And yet, there was still one more test to be done. For the duration of this project, I never revealed my true intentions for choosing this design and making certain specifications, such as the measured specificity of the model's hole and wall thickness, the way I chose to model my support designs, right down to the white-colored filament chosen. I undertook this project under the false pretense of simply having something cool to display, but in reality my end goal lied in something functional,  something that I could use each and every day. In hopes of not being too ambitious I kept this function close to the chest in case of failure and having to pivot. I truly apologize for making you wait this long, but, at the end of this long journey, I am very proud to present one of the greatest pieces of work in my life to date:

                                Isn't she just beautiful? I've had this particular lamp for years now, but it has always been missing a lampshade and been too jarring to use, until now. The 1 cm thickness of the plastic is just enough to give off the perfect muted ambiance to my dining room, where before we only had only harsh overhead lighting. Not even in my dreams when I was first formulating my designs did I ever imagine a result this picturesque. I wouldn't change a thing if I could go back and do it over again, but if I had to make another version it would be very fun to try printing an alternate color variation or to see what the structural integrity of the model can handle -- could it withstand having half the thickness, and does it even need inner supports at all? <br></br>Completing this lithosphere project truly, for me, encapsulated the core values of engineering this semester, and represents a highlight of my academic career. Never before did I even believe I could fully source a project of this caliber on my own, let alone actually carry it through to fruition. It has become a point of pride for me and proof of my abilities as a problem solver and aspiring engineer, as well as (albeit somewhat ironically) a beacon of hope for the future to come.
