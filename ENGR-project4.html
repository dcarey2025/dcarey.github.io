                            We finally have enough CAD and CAM skills under our belts to begin our descent into the class's overarching theme, the immersive world of prosthetic devices. For our fourth project, we were tasked with registering as members of the e-NABLE hub and dowloading open-source resources that would allow us to print and assemble our very own prosthetic device.

                                After reading and watching a couple of different tutorials, it was pretty clear that there was a lack of uniformity on how to properly interface with the e-NABLE community space. Since its such a small community, not many of the projects on the site are reviewed for consistency in design and implementations, and different guides can oftentimes yield different results or call for varying practices.

                            Picking which model to print was an easy enough task, as the Phoenix Hand V3 was recommended as a starting point and was readily available via search. It was also recommended to scale the model to 150%, which could be done directly from the linked Thingiverse download page, before importing the digital object into a CAD or CAM software, as the original design was scaled to fit a child's forearm.

                                Once downloaded, however, documentation provided little direction on how to go about the actual printing of the model's components. Each piece was saved in a separate .stl file, leaving it up to us to assemble them on our printboard in an efficient manner. Additionally, the download packet contained enough components for a complete set of both left and right hands, resulting in many duplicate pins and other assorted pieces. It wasn't clear at first which of these pieces were actually needed for us to fully recreate one hand set, but after some consultation of our documentation we were able to fit all of our required components on the printbed at the intended sizing at once. It was also not completely transparent whether or not the models necessitated the use of support material in order to maintain their structural integrity or not, but for the sake of time and effort, we opted against using them and hoped our prints would still succeed.

                            Unfortunately, there were a few slight complications with the alignment of the Raise3D's printbed when setting the print up, which caused some of the assorted parts (namely, the large palm piece) to fail partway through its print cycle. In a stroke of ingenuity, however, we utilized the assortment of sample and extra pieces in order to fill in for the components that failed, and to give our hand model a stylized design in the process.

                            Using fishing line and dental bands from the provided kits to string each of the components together, our final product was a complete success as a fully functioning prosthetic device that we were able to use to interface with objects around us. Admittedly, we did run into a bit of difficulty when knotting the fishing line around the finger joints, since I'm no boy scout and the documentation certainly didn't have a tutorial on how to tie anything that would hold up to any type of bulk stress. Additionally, we had trouble trying to figure out what screws to use attaching the pegbox to the wristboard, as there was none that came in the supplier box and the documentation was not suited for a 150% scaling. In the end, though, we were able to scrounge together three screws that fit perfectly and got our prosthetic hand up and running.

                                Taking what we learned from building a rudimentary prosthetic such as this, it was very enlightening to think about the strengths and limitations our model designs posed. Tasks of a certain nature, for example would be more adequately suited for the prosthetic's movement capabilities, but many others were still very much out of the question.

                            One such activity that came to mind was playing catch with a ball, which was something that seemed like such an important part of childhood that kids with a limb deficiency would still have difficulty participating in with the existing prosthetic. My proposed solution was to design a modified prosthetic that could simulate a catcher's mitt, allowing kids to squeeze tight in a large area that wouldn't let any potential balls escape. From the components that we had already been using, I drew up and designed a prototype that would mirror the e-NABLE palm, allowing for a set of 10 fingers on the prosthetic hand, including two thumbs, that when closed could create a caged area around a ball. The possibilities of this type of problem & solution design process was certainly invigorating, but little did we know that this exercise was only a taste of what was to come.
