                            Fueled with a rebounding sense of determination, the members of Team Cowabunga took our pivot to an open-source documentation project in stride, continuing to persue our original goals of being able to help as many injured turtles as we could. Only now, with an open source documentation, we wouldn't be limited to only creating a resource for a singular animal, but rather one that anyone can have access to on the internet.

                                After having successfully identified the three main design parameters of our project: namely, material strength, fit quality, and realistic style, we were able to begin undergoing the iterative design processes in order to gradually come closer to a successful end product.

                            Starting with our very first prototype shell model, this standard open-source box turtle model would become the basis for the rest of this project due to its highly-detailed and textured nature, although there are many like it for varying species of turtle across the internet. This initial prototype was printed on the PrusaMini in PLA, and we would quickly use it to test our first design parameter: material strength. Our initial material tests were quite controlled; intending to simulate the sudden collision force of an actual turtle being struck by a vehicle, we performed a series of drop tests on the shell, starting from shoulder-height (appx 4.5-5ft) and ranging upwards of 6 full flights of stairs (appx 48ft). The end result of this test was the breaking of most of the bottom layers of the shell and a complete shearing of the shell's upper half.

                            Unsatisfied with the amount of damage sustained to the PLA model, our team decided to maximize the structural integrity of our next prototype, which we chose to be both a more solid structural design as well as the strongest material at our disposal: Carbon Fiber Nylon polymer. This second prototype was printed on the Raise3D-E2CF. Conducting identical drop tests yielded much more promising results, as the nylon model received only minor shearing on a few of its comparatively weak structural extremities, but receiving little to no noticable damage to its main exterior.

                            Wanting to fully explore the breaking points of different materials in a more standardized manner, we decided to reprint copies of our original box turtle shell model, but this time in four distinct materials: 

                            1. Standard PLA (Black)
                            2. Silk PLA (Brown)
                            3. PETG (Yellow)
                            4. Nylon (Grey)

                            By standardizing the shape, our second round of crush tests were able to qualitatively estimate where each of the materials lay on a gradient of shatter resistance, while also observing their break patterns to check against harmful injuries for potential clients.
                        </p></div>

                            After conducting all four crush tests, we were quite certain in the structural supremacy of the Nylon polymer, as it was significantly harder to break than the other three, which merely shattered under a comparable force. Additionally, even when it did inevitably break our Nylon box turtle shell prototype did not shatter or explode like its counterparts, but rather shear cleanly, without launching any potentially dangerous shards.

                                After having concluded our strength tests, and confidently selecting Nylon as our material of choice, it was time to move on to the second design parameter: how to achieve an adequate fit on the shell cap? And better yet, how to simulate a fit without an injured turtle?

                            By a stroke of ingenuity, we came up with the perfect solution. Yes, our attempts to find a suitable turtle were sadly unsuccessful, but that doesn't mean we couldn't make our own! Using a plastic thermoform machine, we were able to make an inner mold of yet another box turtle shell print, after simply drilling a few holes in the top.

                            This plastic mold fit perfectly on the underside of a complete shell, just how a turtle’s body naturally would. Pairing our broken shell from the original drop tests with this mold, we successfully prototyped a practice injury that we could attempt to mend.

                            With a working injury simulation, it was time to begin creating the actual shell patch. Following up on method #4, we took a detailed 3D scan of our broken shell in order to gain the appropriate topological data that would allow a recreation to fit perfectly into its hole. Using the Artec 3D scanners, an extremely high-definition scan was collected, and after a texture decimation in MeshLab, was able to be imported directly into TinkerCad. Because the Artec scanners are such inaccessible resources, we thought it important to try more affordable means of acquiring this scan, namely using an iPhone camera. Thankfully, new generation iPhones all possess the LiDAR camera required for topological mapping, and as such they are able of capturing large amounts of data points to a surprising level of detail.

                                The final design parameter depended upon the methods by which the patch reconstruction was created. The first method we chose to pursue, method #4, made the most sense to execute as we had an accurate open-source model to fill in our blanks, as well as a highly-detailed topographic scan of the broken area. Without these features, perhaps some other methodology would work better, but for our purposes the design depicted below, now open-source on the TinkerCad workspace, was more than suitable and when reattached to our mock injury was nearly a perfect match.

                            Wanting to explore one final iteration, we chose to entertain method #1 as the simplest entry-level reconstruction option for users with little to no designing experience. Using this method, the user need only fit an assortment of TinkerCad's 3-D polygon shapes (in this case, a singular half-sphere) onto the afflicted area, taking care to cover the entire topological surface of the break points in question. While not as visually pleasing as method #4, this method is equally if not more effective in its fit quality, and will almost certainly provide additional structural integrity due to its thicker and less complicated structure.

                                The completion and success of this project, and of this class as a whole, has proved to be an extraordinarily fulfilling and enriching process that I personally have learned as much from as I have enjoyed. This is not just because it is very fun to play with big machines (although that may contribute a small part in the matter), but because the problem-solving methodology that is learned and implemented on a regular basis is wholly worthwhile. I have learned to take these skills with me into the real world, because the future is invented with each individual step forward. More importantly, I have learned to embrace and chase my dreams. After all, who but ourselves can say what it is we are truly capable of?
