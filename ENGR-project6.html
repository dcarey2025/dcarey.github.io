                            After such a long journey learning the ways of Engineering Design Methodology, it was finally time for us to put our skills to the test with one final project. It would be the greatest challenge we had faced in the world of engineering to date, but the pressure of our goals were only overshadowed by our profound excitement at a chance to solve a real-world problem. My team, Team Cowabunga, decided to commit ourselves to some of the most majestic and deserving creatures we could think of -- the turtle! So, for all the turtles and fellow turtle-lovers out there, this one's for you.

                                Turtle shell reconstructions have been performed on injured turtles of varying species ever since 3-D printing technology came to exist, and this long-standing history inspired us to want to continue this legacy and use our knowledge and facilities to help another animal in need. Many turtles in the wild and as pets experience frequent danger due to their relatively small and slow natures, especially in relation to us humans and our large assorment of vehicles. Road accidents are the most common injury for any turtle, as the impact force of anything moving at any significant enough speeds has the potential to cause serious damage to the structural integrity of a turtle's outer shell, which is simply made up of the same keratinous material as our fingernails.

                            Understanding that the process of matching with a potential client would be a major roadblock from the very get-go, our team quickly mobilized to draft an email template, pictured above, that we periodically sent out to various veterinary practices, wildlife reserves, and rescue clinics around the greater boston area.

                            Upon correspondance, we hoped to match with an animal that we could work with personally to develop a specialized prosthetic reconstruction specially fitted to its injury using a mix of 3D scanning and printing techniques. We would then ask its caretakers a myriad of questions that would better inform us as to the parameters of the animal's circumstances, such as the nature of the client's daily routine and needs, as well as the intent upon completion, i.e. whether the animal was intended to be returned to the wild or kept as a rescue or pet.

                                However, our search to find a cooperative institution was frustratingly unfruitful, as the sheer amount of bureaucratic red tape simply prevented most official organizations from working with third-parties altogether, or at least within our short working window. Similarly, the smaller vet clinics who would be open to collaboration had no cases of these types of injuries in their logs. Each rejection on our long list of inquiries worried us increasing amounts, but hope was not yet lost, and still we pushed forward with the project.

                                As none of the members of Team Cowabunga are turtles, or at the very least turtle owners, it was a quite thought-provoking exercise to try and put ourselves into an animal's metaphorical shoes, imagining, for example, what its daily routine might be like and what it might need to not only survive but thrive in its most comfortable state.

                            Turning to IBM's Enterprise Design Methodology exercises, we took the time to brainstorm the most essential needs of any turtle might be, attempting to identify specific groupings of needs that we could focus on addressing, based on a prioritized basis. Some of the most important groups were that of safety & protection of the animal as it performs its daily activities, comfort & the ability to retain a full range of motion, as well as general stylistic realism to aid in having a sense of normalcy in social settings.

                            The next step in understanding the parameters of our client's prosthesis was to create an Impact/Feasibility chart that would approximately map the importance of specific features of our designs against their difficulty of implementation. Our projections for varying attributes spanned all across the board, as there were some ideas we were more than comfortable with throwing away, while some others shined through as key underlying factors behind many of the similar goals. To address the three main needs stated above, we came to the conclusion that the most important parts of our final product were going to be:

                            1. The strength of the new replacement shell's material.
                            2. The accuracy of the patch's fit, both along the countour of the cracked region as well as the the underside in relation to the top of the turtle's carapace.
                            3. The standardization of the reconsstruction's design as a believable turtle shell, specifically with regards to general shape, which could then be enhanced by additional texturing or painting post-production.

                                Of course, there were still a plethora of ways in which creating an actual reconstruction could be attempted. Some that we brainstormed included:

                                1. Creating a cap or patch by hand using basic polygons to recreate the general structure of the shell's structure
                                2. Copy-pasting a singular hexagonal scute plate design in a desired pattern
                                3. Acquiring a similar open-source material to provide a framework for what is missing from the client's injured area, and filling in the blanks
                                4. Using generative design tools to automatically bridge together gaps and holes using machine learning & AI tools
                                5. Creating a smooth cover plate upon which textured scute plates could be screwed in as necessary

                            Believing it to be the least complicated and most readily available method proposed above, we would begin to pursue the fourth route as the most likely path through which we could achieve success, and as such printed our first model of an open-source design for a Box Turtle shell, which we still hoped would convince a prospective client to potentially work with us. Unfortunately, just as we were securing a promising meeting with the Turtle Rescue League, headquartered in central MA, it was discovered that research cruelty laws prevent any type of animal research, and just like that our long and arduous search for a turtle in need was felled at the stump. Nevertheless, we persevered. We would not let a roadblock such as this get in the way of our mission. We had a sacred duty to the turtles we swore to help, and also still had a final project to complete.
